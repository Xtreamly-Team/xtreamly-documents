This paper presents a looped trading strategy deployed on AAVE V3, dynamically managed
using an Xtreamly AI-driven Volatility Classification Model. The strategy aims to
maximize returns by recursive borrowing and lending, while integrating real-time
volatility detection and multiple risk checks to automatically optimize or exit positions.
